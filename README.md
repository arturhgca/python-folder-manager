# python-folder-manager
A collection of Python scripts under a single manager for diverse operations on Windows folders and files. Includes a command line menu.

# About
This is a toolkit I started developing to automate some of my day-to-day file management tasks on my NAS, media server, and workstation. It's also a platform for me to learn and practice curses-menu.

# TO-DO
- decide upon the initial tasks available
- clean code
- make the menu work
- (maybe) make it cross-platform
